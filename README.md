# SpeechService
SDK for Chinese Speech Recognation and Semantic Understanding.  

SpeechService 是一套提供语音识别和语义理解能力的服务程序，该服务基于科大讯飞开放云平台SDK，在其基础上进行了工程整合和交互流程设计优化。

程序套件运行在V4/5 NAO机器人和Pepper机器人上，适用于Naoqi 2.x系统，随开机启动运行。

无论你是开发大牛还是新入手的开发小白，无论你擅长写c/c++ python java还是前端js高手，

使用该服务套件，你将体验到前所未有的语音交互体验（全链路平均响应耗时500ms左右），

开发者和用户可以免费体验该服务30天，每日交互次数限制在500次。

SpeechService is a middle program for Chinese Speech Recognation and Semantic Understanding used by NAO and Pepper soft engineers, 

which is also based on the famous IFLYTEK voice open cloud platform in China.

Based on it, I have designed and programed them again for a beeter interaction effect.

This middle software can be used by NAO and Pepper robots,which is developed by softback and aderbaran robotics.

so, no matter you have rich experience for them or just a new comer. and it doesn't matter the program language you used is java, python,

c/c++ or javascript, you can always make it.
